## Flooding the zone with shit

The Trump administration is famous for a [strategy](https://www.vox.com/policy-and-politics/2020/1/16/20991816/impeachment-trial-trump-bannon-misinformation) of overwhelming media, institutions, and citizens with a deluge of chaotic and controversial statements and actions. The intent is to distract from the real issues and overwhelm the media and opposition. Often, the intent is simple cruelty.

This timeline of events and actions taken by the second Trump administration (and it's tools) are an attempt to document events in chronological order so that these egregious actions are not forgotten and to help us see the bigger picture unfolding.
