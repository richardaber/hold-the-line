# Welcome

Welcome to the "Hold the Line" handbook. This project is inspired by our excellent civil servants at [r/fednews](https://www.reddit.com/r/fednews/), and is intended to serve as a collaborative document where citizens can find information and resources to help them resist the takeover of our country by insurrectionists, unelected billionaires, and their toadies.
