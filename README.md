# Hold the Line

A collaborative static website intended to serve as a collaborative document where citizens can find information and resources to help them resist the takeover of our state apparatus by Insurrectionists, unelected billionaires, and their toadies.

This project uses [Quartz](https://quartz.jzhao.xyz), an open source static site generator.
